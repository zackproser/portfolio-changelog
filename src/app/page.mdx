## Hello world! {{ date: '2024-02-01T00:00Z' }}

https://changelog.zackproser.com is live!

### <SparkleIcon /> Why did I create this? 

- I want to track ongoing improvements, new featurea and new content as they're added to my site 
- Soon, I'll be launching my digitial school at https://zackproser.com/learn, so tracking ongoing additions, new courses 
and other improvements made there will become key to demonstrating ongoing value.

## Relentless image optimization with .webp {{ date: '2024-01-31T00:00Z' }}

I converted every .jpeg, .jpg and .png file on my site to .webp, for a 76% reduction in file size for my 
`src/images` folder, from 377MB to 78MB.

### <SparkleIcon /> Why? 

- The .webp format now enjoys [broad browser support](https://caniuse.com/webp)
- It is capable of aggressive compression without noticeable image quality loss
- It plays nicely with Next.js's Image component
- It should improve my site performance a good deal, given that previously I was shipping gigantic .pngs and .jpgs
