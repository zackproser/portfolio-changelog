## Digital purchase infrastructure for Zachary Proser's School for Hackers {{ date: '2024-02-02T00:00Z' }}

![](@/images/example-checkout.webp)

After several months of work, I've released my digital purchasing infrastructure to production. 

This integration includes Stripe for payment processing, a full course catalog with support for different course 
statuses: 

- Available (can be purchased and started)
- In-progress (I'm actively building this course)
- Coming soon

It also includes a user authentication system leveraging next-auth and GitHub oAuth to allow students to sign into 
my school, purchase and take courses.

### <SparkleIcon /> It's an exciting time!

After several months of on and off work, I've: 
* Upgraded my Next.js site to use the latest /app router
* Added a complete Stripe integration 

setting the groundwork for my first courses to be published!

Stay tuned!

## Relentless image optimization with .webp {{ date: '2024-01-31T00:00Z' }}

I converted every .jpeg, .jpg and .png file on my site to .webp, for a 76% reduction in file size for my 
`src/images` folder, from 377MB to 78MB.

### <SparkleIcon /> Why? 

- The .webp format now enjoys [broad browser support](https://caniuse.com/webp)
- It is capable of aggressive compression without noticeable image quality loss
- It plays nicely with Next.js's Image component
- It should improve my site performance a good deal, given that previously I was shipping gigantic .pngs and .jpgs
