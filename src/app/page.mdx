https://changelog.zackproser.com is live!

### <SparkleIcon /> Why did I create this? 

- I want to track ongoing improvements, new featurea and new content as they're added to my site 
- Soon, I'll be launching my digitial school at https://zackproser.com/learn, so tracking ongoing additions, new courses 
and other improvements made there will become key to demonstrating ongoing value.
